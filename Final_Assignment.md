# GIT Assignment

Install GIT & make sure it is added into PATH. Please find the Repository link for this section (https://github.com/subhamsatpathy11/Test_Assignment)

## Section 0 -Use GIT as local VCS. Steps to follow:

Q1. Create a directory ‘project_dir’ & cd to ‘project_dir’. 
```
subsatpa@LIN24009587 MINGW64 ~
$ mkdir project_dir

subsatpa@LIN24009587 MINGW64 ~
$ cd project_dir
```

Q2. Initialize git version database.  (git init)
```
subsatpa@LIN24009587 MINGW64 ~/project_dir
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/SUBSATPA/project_dir/.git/
```

Q3. Create a new file index.html.
```
Created index.html in the following directory (C:/Users/SUBSATPA/project_dir/.git/)

subsatpa@LIN24009587 MINGW64 ~/project_dir (master)
$ Touch index.html
```

Q4. Check the git status. You should find index.html as untracked file.
```
subsatpa@LIN24009587 MINGW64 ~/project_dir (master)
$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        index.html

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
Q5. Stage the index.html file.
```
subsatpa@LIN24009587 MINGW64 ~/project_dir (master)
$ git add index.html
```
Q6. Commit index.html
```
subsatpa@LIN24009587 MINGW64 ~/project_dir (master)
$ git commit -m "Commiting"

# GIT Remoting

Objective: Pushing source code into GITHUB & collaborate team members. 

## SECTION-4 (Pushing assignments to remote repository) - Steps to follow:

Q1. Create a github account if you do not have already.
```
Created.
```
Q2. Login on into github account.
```
Logged In
```
Q3. Create new public repository ‘freshersbatch-oct16’.
```
Created a repository named “Section 1” at the starting of the assignment.
```
Q4. Commit & push any sample file to this repository under ‘Assignments’ directory.
```
Committed and pushed all changes through command line time to time throughout the assignment.
```

## SECTION-5 (Pushing source code to remote repository using Eclipse GIT plugin) - Steps to follow:

Q1. One developer from project team will create eclipse projects ‘SampleProj’ & add sample source code files. Then commit all files through eclipse GIT plugin.
Q2. Collaborate other team members with your github account so that they can also modify the committed files. 
Q3. Other developers from same team will checkout all files from remote repository. This might get conflicts since certain files fail to merge. In such case, merge it manually.
Q4. Commit & push the ‘SampleProj’ project.
```

Steps to connect eclipse to GIT
Step 1 - Have generated the token from the developers settings as the password of the authentication process in the Eclipse Workspace.
Step 2 – created a perspective and added the git repository clone with its remote link.
Step 3 – Create a sample java project and teamed it with the git repository added.
Step 4 – Commit and pushed the repository with the help of the access token.
Step 5 - Collaborated with other members in the team and gave the access to modify within the organization.
Step 6 - Ensured Checkouts by the team members for all the file in that particular repository.
Step 7 - Sample Project created through eclipse was pushed, committed and was up to date.
